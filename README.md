#Warning:

the `test1.py` file is the **Main** file. It contains the logic of the project and is the basis of the project

A Python Machine Learning Project using cv zone, Tensorflow, and NumPy. The model was trained by individually recording each alphabet in sign language. The images were then uploaded to https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/, a website made by Google that trains the inserted data and outputs a keras model. Finally, the outputted model in inserted into the project and a separate file is created with the indexes from 0 to 25 with accompanying alphabets. The end product is that the alphabet that corresponds to the sign language hand motion is showcased.
