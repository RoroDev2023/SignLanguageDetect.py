A Python Machine Learning Project using cvzone, Tensorflow, NumPy. The model was trained by individually recording each alphabet in the sign language. The images were then uploaded to https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/, a website made by google that trains the inserted data and outputs a keras model. Finally, the outputted model in inserted to the project and a seperate file is created with the indixes from 0 to 25 with accompanying alphabets. The end product is that the alphabet is showcased that corresponds to the sign language hand motion.
